Round 5: (C Programming Challenge)
Target Teams: Top 15 (Elimination to Top 10)
Objective: Identify and correct the syntax and logical errors in the C code to extract the hidden key phrase.
Output Phrase: WALL BREACHED
 
Challenge Set 1: The ASCII Cipher
Instructions: The following code is designed to translate a sequence of integers into a hidden message by adding a numerical key to each value. However, the code contains 5 critical errors (syntax and logic) that prevent it from compiling and running correctly. Identify the errors and determine the output.
C
#include <stdio.h>

int main( {   

    // Hidden sequence
    int vault[] = {77, 55, 66, 66, 22, 56, 72, 59, 55, 57, 62, 59, 58};
    int key = "10";   

    for(int i = 0; i <= 13; i++) {   
        // The core logic
        printf("%d", vault[i] + key);   
    }

    retrn 0  
}
 
Challenge Set 2: The Memory Reverse
Instructions: This program is intended to print a jumbled string in reverse order to reveal the final password. The developer has left 4 errors in the script. Correct the logic to reveal the secret string.
C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    // A jumbled string
    char message[] = "DEHCAERB LLAW";
    int length = strlen(message);

    for(int i = length; i >= 0; i--) {   
        // Printing backwards
        if(message[i] = ' ') {           
            printf(" "); 
        } else {
            printf("%d", message[i]);    
        }
    }

    retrn 0;  
}
